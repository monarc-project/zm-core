### Changed

- [#14](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-authentication/pull/14) modifies the `Zend\Authentication\Validator\Authentication` class such that
  it now will pull an adapter from the composed `AuthenticationService` instance if no

  instances are already implementations).

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#29](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-authentication/pull/29) fixes how the HTTP Auth adapter treats credentials,
  ensuring it splits only on the first `:` character, and thus allows `:` characters
  as part of the password segment of the credential.

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

  pass against PHP 7.

## 2.5.2 - 2015-06-15

### Added

- [#4](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-authentication/pull/4) adds
  documentation, which can be compiled using [bookdown](http://bookdown.io):
  `bookdown doc/bookdown.json`; docs can then be viewed by starting a web server
  via `php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t doc/html/` and browsing to http://localhost:8000/.

  (Add bookdown globally using `composer global require bookdown/bookdown`.)
